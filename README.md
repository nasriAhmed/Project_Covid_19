#Project "Repair": Development of a hybrid deep learning, quantum and classical approach for the prediction of COVID-19 spread: Case of Africa.
- Propose a hybrid data-driven approach based on a powerful predictive model for early detection of COVID-19, rapid reporting and reliable alert generation using intelligent techniques capable of handling massive data.
- Validate the proposed approach with experiments at the African epidemiological situation.
Environment: Python, Deep Learning(RNN),Quantum,PennyLane, GIT, Docker, Agile.
